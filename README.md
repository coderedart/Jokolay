### Compiling
#### Requirements
1. install rust toolchain with rustup
2. on windows, install visual studio to get your c/c++ compiler/linker sdk.
3. install cmake 
4. on linux, install glfw. on windows, glfw sources will be auto-built from source using cmake.
5. on linux, you need xorg and gtk headers (used for native file dialogs). `xorg-dev libgtk-3-dev` are ubuntu package names.
6. now, you can build it using `cargo` like any other rust project.
